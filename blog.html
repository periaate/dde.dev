		<h1>Building process of this blog</h1>

<p>This &ldquo;blog&rdquo; has taken a lot of development to get it to even a basic state. Speaking of which, this page is not yet finished. <span icon=business></span></p>

<p>Where does the overhead in making a blog come from? To me, the first barrier was the overhead that exists with web development itself.
You need to setup a local server. Simple enough. But what if you want automatic reloads and all those handy things?
I know that there exists tools which do make all of this simpler, but to my eye, these are still quite high overhead.</p>

<p>My solution? I made my own, simple, web development utility. It injects a websocket script into all <code>.html</code> files, and scans files for changes.
Other than that, it&rsquo;s just a local fileserver.</p>

<p>Now I have a smooth development cycle, I save, it&rsquo;ll update the page, and things work as they should. But what about actually writing something?
Am I going to rawdog HTML? Duplicate the head, header, footer, etc.? No, that sounds awful.
Although I looked at existing templating options, none seemed to be that much better than another.
So I decided to make my own, how hard could it be after all? <span icon="clueless"></span></p>

<ul>
<li>Static file web development tooling.</li>
<li>Theme toggling JS.</li>
<li>Generating static HTML from markdown files.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finalized process:</p>

<ol>
<li>list all <code>.part.html</code> files in <code>parts/</code>.</li>
<li>read found files, use the filename without the <code>.part.html</code> as the object keys, the content of those files as the value.</li>
<li>use <a href="https://github.com/gomarkdown/markdown"><code>mdtohtml</code></a> to parse markdown to html.</li>
<li>use JS templating to compile the <code>part</code> files and the compiled html to a single, complete page.</li>
</ol>
