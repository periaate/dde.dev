I like to make software.

1. If it is simple or intuitive to think of, it should be simple and intuitive to do.
2. Software is the interface between man and machine; I want that interface to be as fun and nice as possible.
3. Knowing how to use a tool or library to do something â‰  Knowing how to do that thing.

*They're all WIP*

[Every tool a library; Every library a tool](./posts/tools-and-libraries.html)


*P.s., I need to figure out how to embed the [index](./posts.html) here instead of hardcoding the scribbles. Oh did I mention I'm building the blogging engine from scratch? After all, static parsing md to html seems like it should be simple, so I'll just make it simple and fun! Check it out: [dde.dev](https://github.com/periaate/dde.dev)*
